# OpenSearch AI Project

OpenSearch is an advanced search engine powered by artificial intelligence. This project aims to provide a powerful and intuitive search experience using cutting-edge AI technologies.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- `frontend/`: Contains the Next.js-based user interface
- `backend/`: Contains the server-side logic and AI implementation (to be developed)

## Frontend

The frontend of OpenSearch is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and generates static websites for React-based web applications.

### Setup

To set up the frontend:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Backend

The backend is currently under development. This section will be updated with setup instructions and other relevant information as the backend progresses.
